Windowless
----------

  This is another "Hello World" example program.  This version demonstrates
  Woopsi's capabilities of working with windowless user interfaces.
  
  Although Woopsi supports the windowing paradigm, there is no need to follow
  that convention.  Gadgets can be added directly to a Screen gadget without
  first being added to an intermediary Window.  This allows greater flexibility.
  
  By omitting windows, Woopsi can be used to create more than just desktop-style
  interfaces.  Some example include:

   - Menu systems;
   - UIs without windows;
   - Bitmap-heavy interfaces that disguise Woopsi entirely.
